# Microscale Robotics: from bioinspiration to medicine

Material for classes of the Microscale Robotics course for the PhD in BioRobotics

hours: 20

credits: 2

semester: 2

## Abstract

<!-- This course will introduce the students to the field of micro/nanorobotics, highlighting the main scientific and technological challenges in developing microscale robots. State-of-the-art actuation and control strategies will be discussed, and most relevant micro/nano-fabrication techniques will be presented. Particular emphasis will be given to the aspect of bioinspired design, which has a specially important role in this field, and to the challenges and opportunities offered by the potential applications of micro/nanorobots in minimally-invasive medical applications. -->

This course will introduce the field of microscale robotics. The scientific and technological challenges in developing micro/nanorobots will be discussed. The main approaches adopted to develop microrobots will be presented, in terms of control, actuation and microfabrication. Particular emphasis will be given to the aspect of bioinspired design, which has a specially important role in this field, and to the challenges and opportunities offered by the potential applications of micro/nanorobots in minimally-invasive medical applications.
