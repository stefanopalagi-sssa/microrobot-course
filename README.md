### **Abstract**

**Microrobotics** is an emerging field that addresses the development of **(mobile) robots of microscopic size**  mainly intended for applications in **minimally-invasive medicine**.  
This presents several scientific and technological challenges: 
- what microrobots should look like?
- how to design and build them?
- how to actuate and make them move? 
- how to power them? 
- how to track and control them remotely?
- how to make them perceive and respond to their environment?
- how to make them _intelligent_?

While discussing approaches to tackle these challenges, we will touch on **bioinspired design**, **soft robotics** & **smart materials**, **micro-fabrication**, **medical robotics** & **medical imaging**, **robots' control** and **(physical) artificial intelligence**.

The course aims at introducing microrobotics, while encouraging you to explore and delve into the aspects that interest you the most.
The classes will be interactive and include hands-on experiences and an actual research project.
You will thus experience the **development of an ambitious interdisciplinary project**, from _ideation_ and _planning_, to _execution_ and _reporting_.
