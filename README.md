# Microscale Robotics: from bioinspiration to medicine

_Stefano Palagi_

Material for classes of the Microscale Robotics course for the PhD in BioRobotics

hours: 20

credits: 2 
<!-- commitment: 50h = 20h classes + 30h activities -->

semester: 2



## **Abstract**

**Microrobotics** is an emerging field of robotics that deals with the development of **(mobile) robots of sub-millimetre dimensions** (down to 1&nbsp;&mu;m), mainly intended for applications of **minimally-invasive medicine**.
This presents several scientific and technological challenges: 
- what microrobots should look like?
- how to design and build them?
- how to actuate and make them move? 
- how to track and control them remotely?
- how to make them perceive and respond to their environment?
- how to power them? 
- how to make them _intelligent_?
<!-- 
## &nbsp; -->

While discussing how these challenges are addressed in microrobotics, we will touch on **bioinspired design**, **soft robotics** & **smart materials**, **micro-fabrication**,**medical robotics** & **medical imaging**, **robots' control** and **(physical) artificial intelligence**.

The course aims at introducing microrobotics to the students, while allowing them to explore and delve into the aspects that interest them the most.
The lectures will be interactive and include hands-on experiences and a small project.
The students will thus practice the **development of a collaborative research project**, from _ideation_ and _planning_, to _execution_ and _reporting_.
